# IdleQuest2

Idle Quarry is the humble beginning of an idle fantasy gathering game. This initial iteration focuses on a single action: mining stone with a standard pickaxe.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to launch the prototype. No build tooling or servers are required.

## Current features

- Stylised interface that establishes the tone for the rest of the settlement.
- Manual and automated mining loop using the starting pickaxe.
- Inventory readout for stone chunks and an activity log that chronicles each haul.
- Auto-continue toggle to keep swings going while you attend to other tasks.

## Next steps

- Introduce tool durability, upgrades, and recipes unlocked by specific totals.
- Add additional gathering skills (logging, foraging) to broaden the settlement economy.
- Persist progress between sessions so work at the quarry is never lost.
